# 9xf loops v0.9.1:

A research harness for autonomous, self-prompting coding loops. You give it a
one-time goal; it then repeatedly reads its own codebase and history, generates
its own next sub-task, writes code, validates it, and commits — with no human in
the loop. The research artifact is the git history plus `loop_log.jsonl`.

v0.3 shifted the harness from pure observation toward **goal completion**: the
goal is decomposed into a task list, progress is tracked per task, the loop can
recover from regressions (auto-revert) and hard-stuck states (branch-and-explore),
and a run can FINISH — verified against held-out acceptance criteria — instead
of only hitting the iteration cap.

v0.4 turns the harness into an **overnight engine**: the bet is that a small
local model (7B/20B class) plus hours of verified search can approach big-model
output quality — trading time, which is free, for API spend, which isn't. New: an
in-iteration repair loop (validation errors fed straight back to the executor),
best-state checkpointing (`keep_best` — the run ships the best state it ever
reached, not the last one), wall-clock budgets (`9xf run --hours 8`), and an
`--preset overnight` that turns every search mechanism on at once.

Current builds also log model/backend telemetry per iteration (`model_calls`:
purpose, prompt/response size, latency, temperature, and errors) and retry
malformed executor output immediately before spending a full iteration on a
format mistake. This matters for local models: the harness should spend
overnight compute on verified code search, not on preventable protocol drift.

v0.5 adds the **arena** (a successive-halving tournament of seed runs — built
for single-machine compute), **context safety** (the snapshot budget is derived
from `num_ctx` so prompts can't silently overflow the window; overflows are
detected and logged; over-budget files get function-level partial rendering
instead of collapsing to one line), and an **interactive UI** — run bare `9xf`
in any folder and drive everything from menus, no paths or flags to remember.

v0.6 adds the **app**: a chat-style UI (`9xf app` in any browser, or the
Electron desktop app in `app/`) — pick a folder, type a goal, hit start, and
watch the loop think in chat bubbles with a live code-diff panel alongside.
Every mechanism remains logged and toggleable, so earlier behavior stays
reproducible as the control in A/B runs.

Built per the LoopForge research PRD. Pure Python stdlib — no pip dependencies.

## Quick start

The no-flags way: install, then run bare `9xf` anywhere. You get menus —
start a new run (regular or overnight), start an arena, open any registered
run by number, watch the dashboard. Inside a run folder, `9xf` opens that
run's menu directly.

```bash
pip install -e .
9xf
```

The flags way:

```bash
# install the `9xf` command (or skip and use `python3 -m ninexf` from this repo)
pip install -e .

# create a run (local model via Ollama is the default)
9xf init --goal "Write a CLI tool that organizes files by type" \
         --model ollama/qwen2.5-coder:7b --dir ~/runs/organizer

# stronger local option if you have the RAM:
#   ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
#   9xf init --goal "..." --model ollama/gpt-oss:20b --dir ~/runs/my-run

# start the loop
9xf run --dir ~/runs/organizer --max-iterations 20 --delay 30

# observe
9xf status --dir ~/runs/organizer
9xf log    --dir ~/runs/organizer
9xf watch  # live dashboard for all registered runs (opens browser)
9xf report --dir ~/runs/organizer  # generates REPORT.md
git -C ~/runs/organizer log --oneline

# stop gracefully (or Ctrl+C the running loop — same clean shutdown)
9xf stop --dir ~/runs/organizer
```

## Overnight mode (v0.4)

The democratization thesis: frontier-model quality is mostly *verified search*,
and a harness can supply the search even when the model is small. A 7B model's
first attempt is weak; its hundredth validated, repaired, critic-reviewed,
best-of-N-selected attempt — measured against held-out acceptance tests, with
the best state ever reached checkpointed — is a different animal. You pay in
hours instead of dollars.

```bash
# set it up before bed
9xf init --goal "Write a CLI tool that organizes files by type" \
         --preset overnight --dir ~/runs/organizer

# 8 hours of verified search, then a clean shutdown
9xf run --dir ~/runs/organizer --hours 8

# in the morning: the best state the run ever reached, plus the full story
9xf status --dir ~/runs/organizer
9xf report --dir ~/runs/organizer
```

What `--preset overnight` turns on (each independently configurable):

- **In-iteration repair** (`repair_attempts`, default 1; overnight 2): when an
  executor attempt fails validation, the broken file contents and the exact
  errors are fed straight back to the executor for an immediate fix — seconds,
  instead of a full re-plan round trip. Repairs are logged per iteration
  (`repairs`), so repair efficacy per model is itself research data.
- **Format retry** (`format_retry_attempts`, default 1; overnight 2): if the
  executor has a usable intent but misses the required `SUMMARY:` + `FILE:`
  block protocol, the harness asks for the same change again in parseable form
  before touching the working tree.
- **Self-reflection** (`reflection_enabled`, default on): after failures,
  regressions, stuck signals, parse drift, and periodic green iterations, the
  model performs a no-write reflection pass over recent evidence. It emits
  compact `LEARN:` / `AVOID:` / `TRY:` guidance into `NOTES.md`, which is fed
  back into future planner and executor prompts. This is the loop refining its
  own working prompt, not just checking off tasks.
- **Best-state checkpointing** (`keep_best`, default on): every committed state
  is scored — held-out acceptance first, then validation, task progress, test
  count — and at shutdown the working tree is restored to the best-ever state
  if the final one is worse (`restore_best` event). This makes overnight wall
  time strictly additive: a run can wander at 3am without costing you the
  thing it built at 1am.
- **Wall-clock budget** (`max_hours` config or `9xf run --hours 8`): the loop
  stops cleanly at the deadline, whichever comes first against the iteration cap.
- **Maximum search**: best-of-3 candidates on *every* iteration (not just fix
  mode), the critic reviewing every passing diff, branch-and-explore enabled
  with a higher episode cap, and held-out acceptance tests generated at init.

Recommended overnight pairings:

- `ollama/qwen2.5-coder:7b` when you want a fast baseline.
- `ollama/gpt-oss:20b` when you want a stronger local model and have the RAM.
  Install it with `ollama pull gpt-oss:20b`.

For either model, raise `num_ctx` to 32768 in `9xf.config.json` if you have the
RAM. As of v0.5 every context budget scales off `num_ctx` automatically, so
that one knob is the whole tune.

Large local models can also need several minutes for a cold first response.
`backend_timeout` controls model HTTP calls separately from
`validation_timeout`; the default is 900s, and overnight mode uses 1200s.

## The app (v0.6)

A dark, chat-style interface for the whole workflow: **open → pick a folder →
type a goal → go.** The left pane is the conversation — every iteration appears
as a planner bubble (the sub-task it chose) and an executor bubble (what it
did, which files, validated ✓/✗, repairs, best-of-N, acceptance status), with
harness events (decompose, verify, revert, explore, finished) as system lines.
The right pane is the live code diff — it follows the latest commit, or click
any bubble to pin that iteration's diff.

Two ways to run the same UI:

```bash
# in any browser — zero dependencies, same stdlib-only harness
9xf app

# as a desktop app (Electron shell with a native folder picker)
cd app && npm install && npm start
```

The Electron app is a thin wrapper: it spawns `python3 -m ninexf app` and hosts
it in a native window — all UI and logic live in the Python package
(`ninexf/webapp.py`), so the browser and desktop experiences are identical.
The app can start sessions (it inits the project and spawns a detached
`9xf run`), resume stopped ones, and request clean stops; everything it shows
comes from `loop_log.jsonl`, `state.json`, and git — the same artifacts the
CLI and dashboard read. The server binds to 127.0.0.1 only.

## Arena mode (v0.5)

The failure mode `keep_best` can't fix is a run whose *plan* was bad from
iteration 1 — it never reaches a good state worth checkpointing. The arena
answers "was my first decomposition a dud?" in the first hour instead of at 7am:

```bash
9xf arena --goal "Write a CLI tool that organizes files by type" \
          --seeds 3 --hours 8 --dir ~/runs/organizer-arena
```

- K independent seed runs of the same goal, each with its own decomposition
  (sampling temperature varies per seed for diversity), all sharing ONE
  held-out acceptance suite so scores are comparable.
- Each seed gets a burst: half the total budget split K ways. A seed that
  FINISHES during its burst wins instantly.
- Seeds are scored with the keep-best fitness tuple (acceptance > validation >
  tasks > tests); the winner gets the entire remaining half of the night.
- **Sequential on purpose**: on one machine, parallel runs buy nothing — Ollama
  serializes inference, so simultaneous loops just alternate model calls. The
  arena allocates the same total compute as one long run: diversity early,
  depth late, zero extra RAM.
- `ARENA.md` at the arena root summarizes scores and points at the winner.

## Context safety (v0.5)

Ollama truncates silently from the TOP when a prompt exceeds `num_ctx` —
dropping the system prompt and the goal first, which makes a loop quietly
aimless with no error anywhere. v0.5 closes this three ways:

- **One knob**: `context_char_budget` defaults to 0 (auto) and is derived from
  `num_ctx` (reserving room for the reply), so the snapshot budget and the
  model's window can't drift apart. Set it explicitly to override.
- **Overflow detection**: every Ollama response's `prompt_eval_count` is checked
  against `num_ctx`; a filled window prints a warning and sets
  `context_overflow: true` on the iteration log entry (and a report stat).
- **Partial file rendering**: an over-budget but relevant file no longer
  collapses straight to a one-line stub. The middle tier keeps the header and
  the full bodies of defs/classes relevant to the subtask, collapsing the rest
  to `def name(...): ... # body omitted (N lines)`. The relevant 40 lines of a
  400-line file is usually all the executor needs.

## How an iteration works

1. Read `goal.txt` (never modified by the agent)
2. Snapshot the codebase (file tree + `src/`, `tests/`, and `tools/` contents,
   trimmed to `context_char_budget`; what got trimmed is noted in the prompt)
3. Read recent `loop_log.jsonl` history
4. **Planner call** — the meta-prompt asks for the single most useful next step
5. **Executor call** — the model returns `SUMMARY:` + `FILE:` blocks with
   complete file contents (plain text, not JSON — far more reliable for 7B
   local models). Optionally emits `RUN_TOOL: <name> <args>` to run helper
   scripts from `tools/`.
6. Validate: `py_compile` every written file, run the entry point, then run
   `python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .` if tests exist. A failed
   validation triggers up to `repair_attempts` immediate repair calls — the
   errors and broken file contents go straight back to the executor (v0.4)
7. Commit — **failed attempts are committed too**; failures are research data
8. Append the JSONL log entry (also committed, so log and history stay in sync)
9. Sleep, repeat

## Goal completion (v0.3)

The loop's state machine:

```
init ─► decompose (iter 1, 1 LLM call) ─► build ◄────────────┐
              prev failed: ─► fix                             │
              every review_every: ─► review                   │
   N consec failures ─► [auto-revert to last green] ─► build  │
   hard-stuck ─► [branch-explore, adopt winner] ─► build      │
   all tasks [x]/[!] ─► verify_done ── any FAIL (new tasks) ──┘
                              └── all PASS + harness green ─► FINISHED
```

- **Decomposition**: iteration 1 breaks the goal into `TASKS.md` (checkbox task
  list) and `ACCEPTANCE.md` (observable criteria). Both are harness-managed and
  agent-read-only. The planner names which task each step advances (`TASK Tn:`);
  the harness marks tasks done only after a green iteration plus a YES from a
  one-line completion check. Tasks failing `max_task_failures` times are
  deferred (`[!]`) so the loop stops grinding.
- **Verify-done & FINISHED**: when all tasks are resolved, the harness runs full
  validation + the held-out acceptance suite, then asks the model for a
  per-criterion PASS/FAIL. The model can only *block* finishing, never force it
  — finishing requires the harness checks green too. Failures append corrective
  tasks and the loop resumes building.
- **Auto-revert**: after `revert_after_failures` consecutive failures the
  working dirs are restored to the last green commit (by path checkout — git
  history stays linear). Capped at 2 reverts to the same commit, then the
  failing task is deferred instead.
- **Stuck detection v2**: four signals — `repeat` (similar subtask), 
  `oscillation` (A-B-A), `no_writes`, `same_error` (normalized error signature
  recurring) — each logged in `stuck_signals` and answered with a
  signal-specific re-plan nudge.
- **Smart context**: `context_strategy: "relevance"` scores files against the
  current subtask (mentions, recent errors, recent writes, import-graph
  neighbors, token overlap) and fills the budget by score; over-budget files
  keep a one-line def/class stub. A `WHAT CHANGED LAST ITERATION` git diff and
  a persistent `NOTES.md` (agent `NOTE:` lines + harness observations,
  self-reflection guidance, FIFO-capped) round out the model's memory. `"brute"`
  restores v0.2 behavior.
- **Held-out acceptance tests**: `9xf init --acceptance-tests` generates
  `acceptance/test_acceptance.py` from the goal at init. The agent can't write
  it and never sees its contents — only the criteria text. It gates
  verify_done, not commits.
- **Critic** (`critic_enabled`): a passing change's diff is reviewed before
  commit (`VERDICT: ACCEPT|REVISE` + `ISSUE:` lines); REVISE triggers one
  re-execution with the issues attached.
- **Best-of-N** (`best_of_n` > 1): sample N executor candidates at varied
  temperatures, validate each (restoring the tree in between), commit the best.
  Defaults to fix-mode only (`best_of_mode: "fix"`) — local-model latency is real.
- **Branch-and-explore** (`explore_enabled`): when stuck signals persist *after*
  a revert, two genuinely different approaches are tried on git branches; the
  winner is adopted on main by file checkout, the loser kept as
  `explore-iN-x-rejected`. The JSONL log is written only on the main branch.

## Smarter loop core (v0.2)

- **Iteration modes**: `build` (default), `fix` (previous iteration failed),
  `review` (every `review_every` iterations, default 5). The mode is passed to
  the planner and prefixed in commit messages.
- **Stuck detection**: compares each new subtask against the last 5 via
  `difflib.SequenceMatcher` (>0.85 similarity = repeat). On repeat, the
  planner is re-asked once with an anti-repetition nudge; the event is logged
  as `stuck_detected: true`.
- **Regression flagging**: if an iteration that previously passed now fails,
  `regression: true` is set and an explicit notice appears in the next
  iteration's history context.
- **Test execution**: if `tests/test_*.py` exist, unittest discovery runs in
  the same sandboxed subprocess as validation. Results appear in the log as
  `tests_ran` and `tests_failed`.

## Self-created tools

The agent can write helper scripts under `tools/` (same sandbox as `src/` and
`tests/`). They are discovered automatically, listed in planner/executor
prompts, and can be invoked via `RUN_TOOL: <name> <args>` lines in the
executor output. Tool runs are capped at `max_tool_runs_per_iteration`
(default 3) and their output tails feed back into the next iteration's
history — so the loop can learn from its own helpers.

## Containment

- Writes are only allowed under `src/`, `tests/`, and `tools/`. Every
  model-supplied path is resolved and checked; escapes (`../`, absolute paths,
  symlinks, `.git/`, protected files) are rejected and logged as `violation`
  events.
- `STOP` file anywhere in the project folder → clean shutdown (commit, log,
  exit) at the next iteration boundary. `Ctrl+C` does the same; a second
  `Ctrl+C` force-quits.
- Iteration cap (default 50), model-call backend timeout (default 900s), and
  per-run validation timeout (default 10s).
- Network is off by default for validated code: on macOS the validation
  subprocess is wrapped in `sandbox-exec` with a deny-network profile
  (best-effort — falls back to a stripped-env run if unavailable). Opt in with
  `9xf init --allow-network`. Note: the *model* backend obviously needs to
  reach Ollama/the API; the restriction applies to the code the agent runs.
- Three consecutive backend failures → clean shutdown (so a dead Ollama server
  doesn't spin forever).

## Models

Set in `9xf.config.json` (written at init, never modified by the agent):

- `ollama/<model>` — local, default (`ollama/qwen2.5-coder:7b`); endpoint
  configurable via `endpoint`. Recommended options include
  `ollama/qwen2.5-coder:7b` and `ollama/gpt-oss:20b`.
- `anthropic/<model>` — API mode for comparison runs; reads the key from the
  env var named by `api_key_env` (default `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- `mock` — deterministic scripted backend for testing the harness itself.
  Scenario variants drive specific harness paths: `mock/finisher` (runs to
  FINISHED), `mock/regressor` (forces auto-revert), `mock/explorer` (forces
  branch-and-explore), `mock/repairer` (forces the in-iteration repair loop)

## Testing the harness

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
```

End-to-end scenario tests run real loops in temp dirs against the mock
scenarios and assert on `loop_log.jsonl` + git; unit tests cover the task-list,
stuck-signal, relevance-scoring, and candidate/critic parsers.
